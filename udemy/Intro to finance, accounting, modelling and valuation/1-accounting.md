Balance Sheet - What do I own?
Income Statement - How much do I make?
Cash Flow Statement - How much do I really have?

Income Statment
What is it? Tells you about revenue or sales (TOP LINE)
Why? You'll never know how much a company is worth

Revenue - Expenses = Net Income (Bottom Line)

Revenue (Top Line): Sales 
Expenses: Cost of goods sold + labour + depreciation
Income: Revenue - expenses - tax

If you forecast revenue properly, everything is a percent of that.
