### Data Collection
Bruce Schneier's book "Data and Goliath" investigates the problems associated with modern-day ubiquitous mass surveillance. He is equally critical of both Government (in this case, the United States) and corporate surveillance. 
A major issue he points out is that people allow Governments access to their private data through mass surveillance because of fear (most notably, of terrorism) but fail to understand the terms and effects of that surveillance. For instance, mass suveillance enables discrimination based on any cirteria - race, creed, age, geneder, nationality. There is no recourse against this discrimination, nor any means to opt out of it. On top of this, most people underestimate how much data is generated through mass surveillance, and how easy it is for corporations and governments to store it.

### Analysing our data
Schneier also talks about how even if we wanted to anonymise the data to maintain privacy, doing so is difficult. It's easy to identify people based on a small amount of data points. For example, you can be uniquely identified from just 4 time-date location points.

A particularly interesting assertion by Schneier is that dragnet-style mass surveillance by the NSA has not led to a single meaningful terrorist conviction in the United States. The most successful law enforcement breakthroughs have all been the result of targeted investigation work. Schneier thus argues that the underlying premise by which the United States undertakes mass surveillance is itself flawed.

### Political Liberty and Justice
One argument that Schneier makes against mass surveillance is that we should be free to associate with anyone without worrying about how those actions could be misinterpreted by a future Government. He uses the example of how many career academics were treated during the cold war, simply because they had entertained communist thinking (which was academically fashionable at the time) earlier in their careers. Since all the data collected by mass surveillance can be stored indefinitely, Schneier argues that we should not be subject to surveillance which is essentially indefinite, since Governments and ideologies change.

### Commercial Fairness and Equity
Another scenario that Schneier explores is the ability for social media corporations to use mass surveillance and data collection to facilitate control. He notes that the the FaceBook "I voted" button used in the last election could have been manipulated by FaceBook to show only one political party; utilising the 'bandwagon effect' to influence voting patterns. More maliciously, any large social media site could change public discourse by supressing certain information and amplfying others according to a political agenda.

### Business Competitiveness
Schneier also points to evidence that the NSA's hacking of US equipment to perform mass surveillance hurts US companies. The world knows that US companies give information to the NSA & US Government, which make American firms less competitive when bidding for large international tenders.

### Privacy
Schneier is at odds with proponents of mass surveillance that use of oft-quoted phrase: "If you aren't doing something wrong, you shouldn't have anything to worry about." He points out the absurdity of this statement by suggesting that there are many things we don't want others to know that are perfectly legal: making love, going to the bathroom, singing in the shower, looking for another job without telling your employer.

He asserts that privacy is an inherent human right, and it is about choice. Being able to achieve privacy is an expression of agency.

### Principles - Transparency, Oversight, Accountability
Schneier outlines three key principles that should be used to improve privacy going forward: transparency, oversight, and accountability. 

Transparency means individuals should enjoy privacy, whilst instituations should be transparent in their use of mass surveillance. This is because institutions have more power than the individual, and this power imbalance must be reduced.

Oversight means more strategic oversight through open independent courts, auditing from watchdog institutions, and a legal framework for whistleblowing.

Accountability means the introduction of meaningful penalties for abuses of power.
