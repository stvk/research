**Book Review - Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military, by Neil DeGrasse Tyson**

Neil DeGrasse Tyson opens his discussion by first reviewing the historical scientific and non-scientific precursors to astrophysics; astronomy and astrology respectively. He transitions to the field of astrophysics with a discussion of the technological pre-cursors that allowed the branch of science to flourish in the first place - namely the development of focusing lenses and the invention of the telescope.

The 'unspoken alliance' referred to in the title is thereafter explained numerous times as the emergent property of a natural overlap between astrophysical and military research and technology objectives. Neil DeGrasse Tyson cites a number of fascinating examples, including those which I’ve summarised below:

Whilst the latter half of the book is largely concerned with the history of war and peace-time policy and strategy stemming from the space race and into the present day, during his discussion of satellite technology, Neil DeGrasse Tyson makes mention of Chinese advances in quantum cryptography under the QUESS (Quantum Experiments at Space Scale) program. At one point, he refers to the quantum key exchange capabilities that are the promise of today’s quantum communications satellites as providing ‘unhackable’ encryption for military communications and command and control systems.

That phrase ‘unhackable’ provokes a natural skepticism for anyone who works in the field of cyber-security.
