"Sandworm" is a thoroughly researched, investigative text that analyses a number of well publicised cyber attack campaigns. It ties them together under the titular attack group, through common threads such as use of the Black Energy malware, as well as via Dune-themed metadata associated with seemingly different business email compromise campaigns (with the name Sandworm itself being coined as a tribute to the leviathans lurking below the surface in the Dune story).

The Sandworm campaigns in 2015 against Ukraine's electricity grid were arguably the first cyber attack against industrial control systems that impacted non-military targets.

The sustained Sandworm 2008 DDoS attacks against the Estonian Internet infrastructure was another example of how this threat actor targeted national critical infrastructure ostensibly for political and military gain.
The Sandworm group were also implicated in the Olympic Destroyer cyber attack during the 2018 Winter Olympics, as well as The Shadow Brokers' leaks of NSA hacking tools. 

Of particular note, the Olympic Destroyer attack was originally attributed to North Korea (and outlining the so-called attribution problem of cyber threat detection and response), due to the number of false flags planted by the threat actor. This red herring was eventually debunked through the discovery of falsified metadata within the binary. The binaryâ€™s headers looked to be forged to provide the false flag that the malware had been compiled by a threat actor group called Lazarus, attributed to North Korea. Manual analysis of the code revealed that the compiler in question could not have generated the binary code. It was only later that the campaign was tied to Sandworm, when malware researchers discovered links between previous Sandworm campaigns and the Olympic Destroyer attack, through the use of a common, open source macro obfuscation tool: Malicious Macro Generator.

Throughout the text, "Sandworm" investigates the possible motivations and origins of the threat actor, suggesting that Russia's main intelligence arm, the GRU, housed the units responsible for each of these campaigns.
